## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Very light grey (#F0F0F0) for a clean, modern backdrop.
- Accent color: Vivid Purple (#BE42FF) to draw the user's attention and to add interest. The purple is relatively close on the color wheel to the primary indigo color but with significantly boosted saturation and brightness.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a modern and neutral aesthetic.
- Minimalist line icons to represent clothing categories and other features.
- Responsive grid layout adapting to different screen sizes, ensuring optimal viewing on all devices.
